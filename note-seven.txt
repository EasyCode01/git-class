UNDOING THINGS

checkout commit
revert commit
reset commit

checkout commit: to see what the code looks like at a particular point (readonly)

revert commit: more like overriding not necessarily deleteing the commit history

reset commit: will permanently delete the commit and your code will go back to the way it was
at that particular commit history.  

CHECKOUT commit
git checkout af64hd63

git checkout master

REVERT commit
git revert af4h463

scary screen
you can leave the commit like that or rename the commit

so basically this commit has undone everything we did in that commit

RESET commit
git reset afehj3u3

reset a commit to a particular commit

if we check the commit histroy(git log --oneline we see that we are now on that commit it self)
but the changes we have made so far is still hanging around in the editor.
May be if we change our mind and put all of this in one single commit.
or rewind in time and not preserve this changes..

git reset afehj3u3 --hard 
then those changes will be gone
