Git is a distributed version  control system

That basically means 

1. It's a system that records changes to our files over time

2. We can recall specific versions of those files at any given time

3. Many people can easily collaborate on Project and have their own version of project files
on their computer

Why Use Git   
e.g clients and developer

1. store revisions in a project history in just one directory
2. rewind to any version in the project i wanted to
3. work on new feature without messing up the main codebase
4. Easily collaborate with other programmer
