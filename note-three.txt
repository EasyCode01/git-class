GIT MECHANICS

1. A repository(repo) a container for your project you want to track with git
any time we make changes git will recognize it and track things for us


2. commits:
commits are save points
e.g project level at one time. e.g header, main, footer, js etc.
5 different commits.
And we can go back to any of this save points.

3. Stages
Modified - when we make changes on a file for example they go to the modified stage but they 
are not ready for committing

Staging area - if we decide we want to, we can add them to the staging area, we add any changed files
to the staging area that you want to commit 

commit - Any files in the staging area are added to the commit when we make one

This is how git works

Soon we'll start making branches
