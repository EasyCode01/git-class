COLLABORATING ON GITHUB
ASSUME THE REMOTE REPO IS WHAT WE'LL ALL BE WORKING WITH 

1. Make sure I'm on the master branch
2. git pull origin master : it fetches all of the code from the remote and 
merges it into the master branch and updates it.

3. checkout a branch so you can start working on.
4. add to the staging area, commit 
5. So before we merge to the master branch
6. we push the branch: git push origin branch name
7. Go to the online repository : compare and pull request
8. create a pull request: and other reviews would see it
9. if we are all happy we can merge the request
