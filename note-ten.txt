GITHUB
Is a service that let's us set up hosted repositories or online repository 
ANyone can go online and see the code

e.g imagine we have four developers who wants to work on a project remotely(together)

we setup an online(central) repository which we can all access from our computers

so what we can do is to clone this repository into our own computer, and begin to work on
 it(develop new featrue) locally on our own computer. Which actually is a good way to 
 collaborate.

so when they are happy with it they push it to the repository and merge it to the master 
branch, then other people can pull that code to their own local computer to update their own 
local version so everyone is in sync with the main code base.
So can all work on our own features in our own time and then push it up to the online code base
and other developers pull down the code.

 Setup a Github accout

1. When we already have a local repository.
create a repository on github.

PUSH CODE TO REMOTE REPO
to push the code up to the remote repository

a. Make sure the branch is clean
b. git push address branch.
c. Done.

So Another developer can come to this repo and clone it on their machine locally

NEXT TIME WE WANT TO PUSH
i. so need to create an alias for our repo
git remote add origin address

==> then
git push origin master

2. When we don't have a local repository

a. create the repo
b. clone the repo : git clone address
c. cd to the repo
to push to the online repository
git remote -v
git push origin master
